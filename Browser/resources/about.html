          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Adventists have been known uniquely within the Christian community as "people of the book (Bible)" for our clear position of relying on the Bible only as our source of authority and our emphasis for all members to be "students of the word".  This is in distinction to other groups which may include other sources of authority alongside the revealed word (tradition, charismatic experience, direct "word from the Spirit").  A second distinction would be the Adventist belief in direct access to God without the need for human intermediaries (priests, or church leaders).  We understand that salvation is not mediated by the church but is provided as a gift of God's grace directly to the believer. <br><br> Historically, Adventists see their theological or spiritual heritage being that of those groups of Christians who were seen as "heretics" by the mainline churches of Rome and Constantinople and were therefore excommunicated by them and in many cases persecuted and killed by the mainline churches.  These groups would include such as: Waldenses in N. Italy, Anabaptists, the Church of the East (Nestorian).  These were groups who maintained an adherence to a pure Biblical faith and were persecuted for this stance by the Roman church, the Byzantine church and later by some mainstream Protestants.  It is interesting to note that it was the same mainline Christian groups which persecuted the "heretical" Bible believing groups, which also persecuted and killed the Muslim.  But it is from these "people of the Book" who were striving to maintain a pure faith that Adventists trace their theological heritage. <br><br> One last point of distinction is that Adventists (as the name means) consider themselves to have a unique role in the end of time, to proclaim and live a message of warning about eminent events of the last day:  the day of judgment, the coming of Isa al Masih, the end of time, the end of evil and creation of a "New earth".  The other part of the name "Seventh-day Adventists" refers to our reverence of Saturday the seventh day as a holy day of worship in memory of God the Creator who created the earth in six days and set the seventh day apart as a sacred day, as recorded in the Torah, in Genesis.  So our defense of Creationism is not only to defend the Biblical narrative but also is rooted in one of our core beliefs in the God ordained sanctity of the seventh day for worship of Him as Creator. <br><br>
	In summary, because of their unique role as an "end time" spiritual movement working to encourage people of all faith systems to take seriously their commitment to God and prepare to meet Him, Adventists see unique possibilities in their relation with Islam to foster deeper trust in God, to lead believers to a "saving faith" and encourage a seriousness in personal preparation for the end of time.  Coupled with this is the need to relate with our Muslim brothers and sisters with respect, understanding and to work together to foster peaceful means of conflict resolution rather than contributing to an escalating militancy in the world. -- Jerald Whitehouse</p>
