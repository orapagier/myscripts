              <h4>Population</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>According to the website Adventist.org, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has a worldwide baptized membership of 21,912,161 as of December 31, 2021. It is one of the fastest-growing and most widespread churches worldwide, with members in over 200 countries. The Seventh-day Adventist Church originated in the United States in the mid-nineteenth century and follows the teachings of the Bible, with an emphasis on the Sabbath and the second coming of Christ</li>
                
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="resume-item">
              <h4>Sub-denominations</h4>
              <p>The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a Protestant Christian denomination that originated from the Millerite movement in the 19th century. It has a worldwide membership of over 21 million people. The Seventh-day Adventist Church is not a monolithic organization, but rather a collection of various subgroups and branches that share some common beliefs and practices, but also have some differences. Some of the major subgroups and branches of the Seventh-day Adventist Church are:</p>
			  <ul>
                <li>The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists is the central administrative body of the denomination, with headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, USA. It oversees 13 divisions that cover different regions of the world. It also operates various institutions, such as schools, hospitals, media centers, and humanitarian agencies.</li>
                <li>The Seventh-day Adventist Reform Movement is a group that separated from the main body of the church in 1925 over the issue of military service during World War I. They believe that Adventists should not participate in any form of warfare or violence, and that they should observe a stricter diet and dress code than other Adventists. They have about 35,000 members in over 100 countries.</li>
                <li>The Davidian Seventh-day Adventists are a group that emerged from a reform movement within the church in 1929. They believe that God has given them additional messages and prophecies through their leaders, such as Victor Houteff and David Koresh. They also believe that they are called to prepare for the imminent establishment of God’s kingdom on earth. They have about 15,000 members in over 60 countries.</li>
				<li>The Adventist Church of Promise is a group that split from the main body of the church in 1932 over doctrinal differences. They reject some of the teachings of Ellen White, such as her views on health reform and the investigative judgment. They also emphasize baptism by immersion and foot washing as essential for salvation. They have about 50,000 members in Brazil and other Latin American countries.</li>
                <li>The True and Free Seventh-day Adventists are a group that separated from the main body of the church in 1925 over organizational issues. They believe that the General Conference has become corrupted and apostate, and that they are the true remnant church. They also reject some of the doctrines of Ellen White, such as her views on health reform and the investigative judgment. They have about 10,000 members in Russia and other former Soviet countries.</li> 
				</ul>
				
				<p>These are some of the major subgroups and branches of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 
          but there are also many other smaller groups and movements within or related to Adventism 
          in various localities worldwide.</p>

            <h3 class="resume-title">Islam</h3>
            <div class="resume-item">
              <h4>Population</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>According to the website Times Prayer, it is estimated that 2,005,636,752 people around 
                  the world identify themselves as Muslims as of today, which represents over 25% of the world's 
                  total population of 8,022,547,009. Islam is the second largest religion in the world after 
                  Christianity. The country with the largest number of Muslims is Indonesia, which has about 
                  231 million Muslims. The country with the highest percentage of Muslims is Maldives, which has a 100% 
                  Muslim population.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="resume-item">
              <h4>Sub-denominations</h4>
              <p>Islam is a monotheistic religion that follows the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, 
                who received revelations from God (Allah) in the 7th century CE. Islam has over 1.8 billion 
                followers worldwide, making it the second largest religion after Christianity. Islam is divided 
                into several subgroups or denominations, each with its own beliefs and practices. Some of the major 
                subgroups and denominations of Islam are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Sunni Islam is the largest and most widespread denomination of Islam, 
                  comprising about 85-90% of all Muslims. Sunni Muslims believe that Muhammad did not appoint 
                  a specific successor before his death, and that the Muslim community should elect its leader 
                  (caliph) based on consensus and merit. Sunni Muslims follow four schools of Islamic 
                  jurisprudence (fiqh): Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi’i, and Hanbali. Sunni Muslims also recognize six 
                  collections of hadith (sayings and deeds of Muhammad) as authentic: Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, 
                  Sunan al-Sughra, Sunan Abu Dawood, Jami al-Tirmidhi, and Sunan ibn Majah.</li>
                <li>Shia Islam is the second largest denomination of Islam, comprising about 10-15% of all Muslims. 
                  Shia Muslims believe that Muhammad designated his cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib as his 
                  successor (imam) before his death, and that only his descendants have the right to lead the Muslim 
                  community. Shia Muslims follow one of three schools of Islamic jurisprudence: Ja’fari, Zaidi, 
                  or Ismaili. Shia Muslims also have their own collections of hadith, such as Nahj al-Balagha 
                  (attributed to Ali) and Al-Kafi (compiled by Muhammad al-Kulayni). Shia Muslims also venerate 
                  certain figures as saints or martyrs, such as Husayn ibn Ali (the grandson of Muhammad), Zaynab bint 
                  Ali (the daughter of Ali), and Fatima al-Zahra (the daughter of Muhammad).</li>
                <li>Ibadi Islam is a third branch of Islam that traces its origins to the early Kharijite movement that 
                  opposed both Sunni and Shia claims to leadership after the death of Muhammad. Ibadi Muslims believe 
                  that any pious Muslim can be elected as imam regardless of lineage or ethnicity, and that imams can 
                  be deposed if they become unjust or corrupt. Ibadi Muslims follow their own school of Islamic 
                  jurisprudence: Ibadi fiqh. Ibadi Muslims also have their own collections of hadith, such as Tartib 
                  al-Musnad by Abu Ya’qub Yusuf ibn Ibrahim al-Warijlani. Ibadi Muslims are mainly found in Oman, 
                  Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and Zanzibar.</li>
                <li>Ahmadiyya Islam is a modern reformist movement within Islam that was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad 
                  (1835-1908) in India. Ahmadiyya Muslims believe that Ghulam Ahmad was a prophet sent by God to 
                  revive Islam and unite humanity under one faith. Ahmadiyya Muslims also believe that Jesus survived 
                  crucifixion and traveled to India, where he died a natural death. Ahmadiyya Muslims follow their own 
                  school of Islamic jurisprudence: Ahmadiyya fiqh. Ahmadiyya Muslims also have their own collections of 
                  hadith, such as Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya by Ghulam Ahmad and Tadhkirah by Mirza Bashir Ahmad. Ahmadiyya 
                  Muslims are mainly found in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and 
                  Canada.</li>
                <li>Sufism is not a denomination but rather a mystical dimension of Islam that emphasizes personal 
                  experience of God through various spiritual practices such as meditation, chanting, poetry, and dance. 
                  Sufism has influenced both Sunni and Shia Islam throughout history and has produced many prominent 
                  figures such as Rumi, Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali, and Hafiz. Sufism is organized into various orders 
                  (tariqas) that follow different spiritual paths (turuq) under the guidance of a master (sheikh or pir). 
                  Some of the major Sufi orders are: Qadiriyya, Naqshbandiyya, Chishtiyya, Shadhiliyya, and Mevleviyya.</li> </ul>
				
				<p>These are some of the major subgroups and denominations of Islam, but there are also many other smaller 
          groups and movements within or related to Islam.</p>
