Determinism is the philosophical belief that all events, including human actions, are ultimately determined by previous causes and natural laws. According to determinism, everything that happens is a result of past events and conditions that are beyond our control. This view holds that the universe operates according to fixed and predetermined rules, and that there is no such thing as genuine free will.
