Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual liberty and the minimization of government intervention in people's lives. It advocates for a free market economy, where individuals are free to engage in voluntary exchanges of goods and services without government intervention, and for the protection of individual rights, including the right to life, liberty, and property.
